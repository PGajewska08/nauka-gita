    <h1>What a wonderful world</h1>
    <h2>by Louis Armstrong</h2>
    <p>I see trees of green, red roses too <br>
        I see them bloom, for me and you <br>
        And I think to myself <br>
        What a wonderful world! 
    </p>

    <p>
        I see skies of blue and clouds of white<br>
        The bright blessed day<br>
        The dark sacred night<br>
        And I think to myself<br>
        What a wonderful world!
    </p>

    <p>
        The colours of the rainbow so pretty in the sky<br>
        Are also on the faces of people going by<br>
        I see friends shaking hands<br>
        Sayin': "How do you do?"<br>
        They're really sayin': "I love you".
    </p>

    <p>
        I hear babies cryin'<br>
        I watch them grow<br>
        They'll learn much more than I'll ever know<br>
        And I think to myself<br>
        What a wonderful world!
    </p>

    <p>
        Yes<br>
        I think to myself<br>
        What a wonderful world!
    </p>
